# Mathematical Mysteries

Module choice for Imperial i-explore module of year 3 Design Engineering. 5 ECTS / FHEQ level 6. Led by Dr Philip Ramsden. 

## Course description

This course examines mysterious mathematical ideas which
do not usually come up in STEM courses. What is infinity, and
is there only one kind? What kinds of symmetry are there, and
how do they relate to one another? How much do we really
know about the familiar counting numbers? Can a shape have
a dimension that is not a whole number? Explore these ideas
and more in this module.

You will learn to define mathematical concepts such as infinity
and fractal dimension, construct rigorous mathematical
arguments, and create elegant proofs. The module will also
teach you to understand the role of maths in STEM and wider
culture and to communicate mathematical ideas in everyday
language.

Contact sessions in the early part of the course will consist of
a mixture of activities including instructor-led explanations,
class discussions and computer practicals. Later in the course,
sessions will be devoted to preparation of your primary project,
and then to presentation and assessment. Outside the contact
sessions, students will participate in activities involving
directed reading, online video and audio content, literature
searches and the preparation of their final project.

Written instructor feedback on the mid-term reflective writing
will be provided within one week of submission, and there will
be spoken instructor and peer feedback on early drafts of the
group assessment. At the start of Term 3, your instructor will
also give you feedback (incorporating peer perspectives) on
the final version of the assessment and the final piece of
reflective writing.

How will this module be
assessed?
• There will be two short pieces of reflective writing, each
worth 5%, submitted in the middle and at the end of
term respectively.
• The main assessment will be a group project,
culminating in either a presentation, video, podcast,
poster, documented visualisation or a documented
piece of software (90%).

The first piece of reflective writing will take place mid-way
through the Spring Term, and the main assessment will be
submitted in Week 9. The final reflective writing activity will
take place towards the end of the course.
