### Game 5 - Chocolate eating game

**Rules of game:** Each player takes it in turns to eat some of the chocolate and whoever is left the last piece of chocolate to eat loses. The rules of eating chocolate are, from whichever square you pick, all squares to the right and above are eaten. This means you must choose squares strategically to ensure you are not left with the poison. </br>
**Winning strategy:** There are 41 safe pieces of chocolate and 1 poisonous piece. Avoid one column/ row being left. At the start, take as much as you want, then when it gets near to the end, ensure there are always a mix of columns/ rows as it easy for the other player to get rid of a whole column or row. </br>
